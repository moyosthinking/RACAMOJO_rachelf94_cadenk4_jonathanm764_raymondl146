Collected Knowledge & Wisdom on
#  Meme Maker API
---
## Provides:
A database of memes uploaded by users all around the world using REST APIs. You are able to post an image link for your meme with any description to the database, update your meme, and view memes posted by others.


### Pain factor: 1

### Key Provisioning:     

- No key is required.

- When uploading your meme, an image URL is required. This API does not host your image for you, so you need to upload your image on some image hosting site (like imgflip or imgur).

- You will need to remember your adminPassword when uploading your meme if you ever plan to edit your submission. IDK how they hash your password, so maybe don't use something super personal lol. 

### Quotas:
- Infinite

## The Good:
Explore memes from Rest API nerds from all over the world.

## The Bad:
A lack of features for getting specific memes. You can't search up the name of the meme; you have to know its ID.

## The Ugly:
The name of your meme has to be unique to all memes that already exists in the database, so it might take some trial and error, especially if you try to upload something unoriginal.
